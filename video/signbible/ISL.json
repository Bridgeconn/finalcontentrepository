          "description": "Genesis which means beginning. It tells the story of how the world began and how God created all things, including animals of different kind and human beings both male and female., Moses, the Prophet, and the leader of Israel was an author of Pentateuch. The first book is Genesis. He wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. All together known as Torah which means law., Bible doesn’t tell exactly when and where Genesis was written, but it was probably written by Moses during the years of Israelites encampment in the wilderness at Sinai., And it may be written to early Israelites after their Exodus from slavery in Egypt before they entered to the land of Canaan.",

In the book of Exodus, the author describes Jacob and his family continuing to live in the region of Goshen which is in Egypt. Later, Pharaoh, king of Egypt made the Israelites enslaved, oppressed, suffered, and worked hard. But all this while, we could learn that God shows His faithfulness, power, love, holiness to the people. He made a covenant with the people of Israelites. This book is written by Moses. He was adopted by one of Pharaoh’s daughters. And as he grew up, he was well educated and well qualified in the house of the Pharaoh. Duration and place of writing After Israelites were out from Egypt towards the land of Canaan, they spent 40 years wandering in the wilderness. They did not reach Canaan land because of their disobedience to God. This is the most likely time for the writing of the book approximately dated between BC 1450- 1410. Recipients The recipients of this book would have been to the generation of Israelites after the Exodus while wandering in the wilderness. At Sinai, Moses wrote the book of Exodus to the people of Israel.",

          "description": "The sign for this book is misleading. It is not a book about people who make decisions in law courts. The book of Judges tells the stories of some of ancient Israel’s greatest leaders, called judges whom God raised to deliver Israelites from their enemies. The book of Judges narrates the history of Israel under these judges from the time they settled in the land of Canaan after Joshua's death to the birth of Samuel (approximately 1400–1000 B.C.). As the Israelites settled in the land of Canaan and lived among the people who were still there and worshiped many different gods. The Israelites often went astray from Yahweh to worship these gods. When the Israelites did this evil in the sight of Yahweh, he allowed the other people to defeat them. But when the Israelites repented and prayed to Yahweh, he sent judges who helped the Israelites defeat their enemies. This pattern happens many times in the book of Judges. It is possible that Samuel assembled some of the accounts from the period of the judges and that such prophets as Nathan and Gad, both of whom were associated with King David’s court, had a hand in editing the material and shaping the Book of Judges.",

Luke was a physician, missionary (associated with Paul in his mission) and above all, a historian. He was very careful both in his gospel and in the book of Acts to give accurate historical details. Luke wrote this historical account on Jesus to Theophilus probably a Roman official to establish him in the faith in Jesus Christ. Theophilus was a believer and then the purpose of the book was edification of the saint.Luke presents Jesus as ‘Son of Man’ ‘Perfect man’ and the key words in this gospel is ‘Salvation’ and ‘Son of Man’.",
