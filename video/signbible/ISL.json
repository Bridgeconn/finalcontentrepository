Luke was a physician, missionary (associated with Paul in his mission) and above all, a historian. He was very careful both in his gospel and in the book of Acts to give accurate historical details.Luke wrote this historical account on Jesus to Theophilus probably a Roman official to establish him in the faith in Jesus Christ. Theophilus was a believer and then the purpose of the book was edification of the saint.Luke presents Jesus as ‘Son of Man’ ‘Perfect man’ and the key words in this gospel is ‘Salvation’ and ‘Son of Man’.Key verses:   2 :15,  4 :18-19,  19:10 ,Key chapters: 1, 4, 15 & 19",
